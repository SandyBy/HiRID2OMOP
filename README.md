# HiRID2OMOP

This repository contains the whole tools and documents to perform an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process for mapping the
[HiRID database](https://physionet.org/content/hirid/1.0/) to the [OMOP Common Data Base Model](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel).
The process involved the transformation and creation of OMOP CDM variables based on the HiRID elements.
